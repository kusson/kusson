Hi, this is Kusson.

I am a self-taught web developer who focus on frontend development at the moment.

Proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript, React and Bootstrap for frontend development, and developing backend skill with Node.js, Express.js, Mongo and MySQL.

Currently, I have a project working on a company website, and looking to build a webapp to enhance it's features.

I aim to become a fullstack developer in the coming year.
